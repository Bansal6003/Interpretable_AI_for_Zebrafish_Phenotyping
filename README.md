# Interpretable_AI_for_Zebrafish_Phenotyping

This project presents deep learning–based automated phenotyping and morphometry for CRISPR-induced zebrafish mutants, developed as part of an NIH R24 resource grant at the University of Utah.

I trained RegNetY-16 classifiers (98.5% accuracy) and DeepLabV3+ segmentation models to extract body-part measurements from 10,000+ larval images across 400+ mutants. 

Visual outputs are validated by domain experts and accelerate phenotyping compared with manual workflows.

## Key Visualizations

- Classification confusion matrices and accuracy plots
  
- Segmentation IoU/Dice curves and masks
  
- Unsupervised UMAP/t-SNE mutants clustering
